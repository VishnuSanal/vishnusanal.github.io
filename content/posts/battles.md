sooo, wanted to write something like this for the longest time -- I just so couldn't. getting the will to publishing it here is another story, btw - credits to this friend for pushing me to do this endeavour! :) so, brace yourselves, here goes... nothing + this is after lots of introspection, discussions & seeking advice. if you think you know better, sorry and thanks, I'm good! what a jerk, huh?

<!--TL: DR; I was in a kinda like a trance situation throughout BTech.-->

TL: DR; no - read! 🤨

now what made me realize all of a sudden?! wait let's start with my theory of how it all began... I was watching this interview prep video, and my thoughts were by the lines of "this will never happen". i.e, I won't ever be able to crack technical interviews.

and, here goes my genesis theory:

I think this started from the conditioning done by the faculties from the entrance coaching class I went to. Basically, the faculties used to tell us everyday something by the lines of "entrances can only be cracked, even just qualified by students who has born-talents", "the ones you get by birth", "none of you have such born-talents", "you will never be able to crack entrance exams!" And, yeah, things kinda ended up such and I was able only able to get a seat in the course I wanted in the very last possible chance and I believed to whatever they've conditioned me with was right. Mind you, I was a student who used to get _"good marks"_ if you will. 100% on SSLC & 97% on HSE.

I felt unworthy, extremely low self-esteem was the issue. I believed firmly that there was "something", that I didn't have, and I can possibly never achieve, to be "successful"; to make it in life.

And, all of my decisions during BTech were entirely driven by this! I was confirmed to complacency of the average; I accepted that only average was meant for me -- and I had better try for survival; for - anything above that was definitely unattainable - so you had better try for just surviving, the bare minimum, to be on the safe side, and not end up as a failure without even making it to the survival level.

I did almost everything with this notion in mind (unknowingly, ofc, but, very very prominently, now that I think about it) -- exams, studies, projects, buses, friends, communication, and oh boy...!

> (skipping some personal stories here -- hope I get confident enough to post them out here in public)

Things surfaced again when I as preparing for this entrance exam again. All these suppressed emotions, fear, survival instincts, etc. started showing once I was studying for this entrance exam again. I started finding excuses to not study, to escape from preparations, for they triggered something inside me. Taking an year off to prepare for the same exam again felt sooo scary and uncertain, and moreover **unachievable**.

Damn, one of my friends even told me not to _"even talk to them"_ (lol) since whatever I was telling felt like I was tryna pull them down! It basically was a downflow of my fears. Please, if you're reading this, ~I tried closure, was unable - consider this an apology, I never intentionally tried to pull you down, nor to manifest negativity to your life.~ update: got closure, thank goodnesss!! 🥺 :)

plus, yes, the things I've talked would've felt demotivating, hopeless, and _negative_ in that sense. I've def talked down on a lot of stuff prior with this notion in mind. If you are one of them, and whatever I've told felt such, please consider this as my way to take them back! I know, whatever I tell now is as futile as trying to catch back an arrow, but yeah, still I can shoot my shot. 🙂

Now what? IDK, I'm trying to acknowledge things, and to act matured to be responsible for my actions -- to do things better. I was unable to achieve a lot of things, things went off from my grasp only because it was my inability to work, and not of anything else. I am still figuring out a lot of stuff most guys my age would have already figured out years ago. I can do things if I want to, yep, there'll be fear of changes, initial resistance, and whatnot?! but, hey, it's time for you to stand up and face them. old things surface sometimes, and it's upto you to handle it better.

I really don't know what future has in store for me, but I really hope, trust & believe that, with grace, grit and persistence, things will fall into place! ;__;

and, btw, you might wonder about the "why?". why am I posting this in public. as far as I'm concerned, this is my was of reacting to, and letting the _"world"_ know the the impacts a _bad_ coaching class can have on a student for years, see.
