Alright, so imagine this context: you're studying about AVL trees. You somehow figure out on how to insert nodes, what types of rotations to perform upon imbalance etc. All good! Now, you move onto study about deletion; as every student does a day before exams: you do a search & some YouTube vidoes show up. And holy moly! You get overwhelmed by the whole saga going on with deletion. There's a freakin' algorithm to study + when it comes to implementation, it's nowhere near relatable to the concepts you learnt with insertion. You struggle to figure out the pattern in deletion & to relate it to the concepts from insertion. You find every resource available to be simply complicated. You wonder whether there was a guide to help you do this. If not for you, I atleast did, literally a day before my exam! Well, here you go with that guide! ;)

So, brace yourself, here goes... nothing!
