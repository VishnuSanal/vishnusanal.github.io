So, you finally decide to work on that document you’ve been putting off for three months, or you want to work on that PPT that is due tomorrow! You grab your tools, open all the resources in 1500 Chrome tabs, and copy pasta everything onto your OverLeaf template. All is well for the first part or so, then you get a warning, and boom, suddenly OverLeaf says it won’t compile anymore! You try compressing your images and shortening the content, only to discover that none of these work. :(

Here’s a lil hack to get you around this dilemma, hang tight! :)
