It was built out of my frustration with my device’s stock music player requesting unnecessary permissions just to play a music file. The basic version was built within a day on a skeletal level. I thought of DMP as a simple project that would only be used by me on my device. I made the code open source \u0026 left it on GitHub.\nSome of the members of the project’s discussion group spotted this new project \u0026 tried it for themselves. They reported some issues with the application. I quickly found a solution and released a fix. Now that I fixed the critical issues, one of them proposed for the app to be included in the IzzyOnDroid repository (a repository by an F-Droid maintainer for the apps that are not “fully compliant” with the main repo). The proposal got accepted, and DMP was live on IzzyOnDroid. I then got some new issues reported requesting new features, and it was then that I started taking the project seriously. Then, I asked for help from a couple of my friends to help me with the design and improve it. I polished the design as per their awesome design. Now, I wanted it to be published in the F-Droid main repository, requested packaging, got accepted; we were live on F-Droid! I still remember getting excited with the comment Andreas (Izzy) left welcoming us to F-Droid.\nMeanwhile, almost a month after DMP got rolled on F-Droid’s repo, I discovered a major issue in the app that was caused by a mistake of mine. I have written a separate blog on that here.\nI carried on working on the app., mostly fixing issues \u0026 working on small features once in a while – viz., playback speed, remembering where you left off, repeat, rewind/seek etc. And life was good! However, a major issue that was still troubling the app was the integration with Android’s MediaSession API. I struggled with this for weeks, if not months. I looked into documentation (that felt complicated) and blog posts/tutorials (that were outdated). Furthermore, I kind of left it the way it was for a while and continued finding workarounds until I decided that I should fix this issue once and for all. I created a new project from scratch \u0026 implemented a simple music player by referring to the documentation \u0026 other sources. This worked, after almost a year! Once this was stable, I migrated this new project into DMP’s codebase piece by piece, fixing the issues that appeared along the way. Remember the sweet feeling of fixing issues you had for a while? The happiness of deleting code that you used to workaround something “unfixable”, now that you found a new way to do it? Finally, v2.0.0 was released with this new architecture.\nDMP got a UI overhaul on the very next v2.1.0 release too.\nNow, DMP is live on Google Play and F-Droid, and I hope users find it handy to have a simple, minimal, and hassle-free dialog music player! :)\nCredit where it’s due: thanks to all the community members and contributors, especially Shuvashish (for all the support, backing, and suggestions), Andreas (for unrelenting support \u0026 suggestions), Jazil \u0026 Ayush (for the gorgeous design), Anand, Aswin, Akash, and Shreya (for testing \u0026 feedback).
